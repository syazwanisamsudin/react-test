In my 1st year, I've enrolled in a Cloud Computing Architecture where we have to design a serverless/event driven solution based on a business scenario. In this case, a business supplier offers a
Web service allowing clients to upload various photo and video formats, along with information,
after authenticating each user's identity and gets confirmation. The whole design is easy to run for
the company and can be managed via any location by Administration. This serverless architecture is designed and implemented in AWS.
